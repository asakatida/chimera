A community project must have a code of conduct.  The code of conduct must be enforced.

Those two ideas are not up for discussion. PERIOD.


I do not have the personal bandwidth to enforce a code of conduct to the level of quality that I expect.  If that changes I will update this proposal.  This proposal exists in its current form to document what is enforced with the bandwidth I have.  It also serves as a dedicated space for discussing the improvement of the current situation.  Any changes will be discussed through an open pull request updating this file.


The code of conduct is simple.  Treat every person in this community as a human.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.


Enforcement of the code of conduct will be as follows.


I am free to take any measures against any person interacting with this project or with those who contribute to it.  I will consider action against any discussion not directly related to a file in this git repository.  I will take steps to resolve any action on the part of myself or others that is perceived as negative by anyone who interacts with or contributes to this project.  This includes interactions outside of the Github platform.
