The Python spec and standard library are well documented.  Neither of those will be duplicated here.  Questions regarding both also belong to other parts of the Python community.

Issues will be reviewed for possible bug fixes.  New features outside the Python spec will not be accepted.  Any issue left open is a welcome start for contributions.

Supported build platforms are specified in CI config files.  Support for new platforms must be accompanied by a support plan to review pull requests changing platform code.
